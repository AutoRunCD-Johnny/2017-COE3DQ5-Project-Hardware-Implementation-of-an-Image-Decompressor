# COE3DQ5-Project-Hardware-Implementation-of-an-Image-Decompressor
This is COE3DQ5 course project. 
See coe3dq5_project_description_2017.pdf get detail description about this porject.

* Decode the specified lossless compressed image format .mic11 and dequantization. Recover the frequency information of YUV of the image.
* Perform IDCT (inverse discrete cosine transform) convert the YUV from frequency domain to spatial domain.
* Upsampling the 4:2:2 YUV to 4:4:4 and color space conversion (YUV to RGB)
* Implement on Altera DE2 board (Cyclone II FPGA)
* HDL: SystemVerilog
